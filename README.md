Todo App
This is a Todo app that I created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It allows you to create and manage your tasks in different projects.

Features
You can easily create, edit, and delete projects and todos.
Each todo has a title, description, due date, and priority (important or not).
You can quickly view all your projects and todos inside them by clicking in the sidebar.
You can filter your todos by project, important, due today/this week, completed etc.
You can mark your todos as complete or incomplete.
Your data is saved in localStorage, so it persists across sessions.
Technologies
This app is built with modern web technologies, such as:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Webpack
